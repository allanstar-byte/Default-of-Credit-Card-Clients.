# Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients.

## Main Objective: 
To estimate the probability of defaulting on  payment by a credit card client based on the historical data provided using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.


## Specific Objectives: 

Based on our  Exploratory Data Analysis ; To identify the demographic that is more likely to  default on their credit card payments and the factors that influence defaulting payment.

To build a classification model that predicts whether a client will default on their payments using R-Programming.

To build unsupervised learning models using Clustering techniques such as K-Means using R-Programming.

To provide insights and recommendations to the institution based on the findings made from our analysis.


## The Experimental Design Taken

We intend to take the following steps in our analysis

Importing the dataset

Performing Data Cleaning

Performing EDA

Building a Supervised Learning Model : A classification Model.

Building an Unsupervised Learning model while applying dimensionality reduction techniques : Clustering Model with K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering.

Providing Recommendations and Insights based on our findings.

## Metric for Success 

The evaluation metric for our Supervised problem will be the confusion matrix .
While the Success for the project in general will hinge on whether we are able to provide gainful insights and recommendations to the Bank .
